## Primer

### Relationship
We read in Genesis how God walks with His people. Sin drove man out of the garden. It makes us to set ourselves against righteousness. But we are reconciled through the work of Christ: As a new creation, we are called to live for Him and through Him.

We are saved once and for all time through faith in the gospel. We cannot add to that salvation. Yet we read in [1 Corinthians 3:12-15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/1co/3/12-15/s_1065012):

>Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man’s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man’s work. If any man’s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.

We are called to be a light in the world, salt in the earth. To be unstained by the present evil age and obey the Lord of Hosts by two great commandments. The first--[love the Lord our God](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/deu/6/4-9/s_159004):

>Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one! You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.

And the second is like it--to love our neighbor.

The Kingdom of God is built on roles and relationships. God is a father, a king, and a savior. We are called to be bondservants of Christ Jesus, children of the most high, and [reign alongside Him as priests](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/rev/1/6/s_1168006).

The [flesh](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/gal/5/16-17/s_1096016) cannot do the will of God. Even the "good" we do is [useless](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/isa/64/6/s_743006). What sort of people, then, ought we be? ([2 Peter 3:11-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/2pe/3/11-14/s_1159011))

### Fruitfullness
When we are filled with the Spirit, it is evidenced by our behavior, thoughts, and speech. When are hearts are inclined toward Christ, and the Word is our meditation, we are fruitful.

The [wise virgins](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/mat/25/1-13/s_954001) were prepared when the bridegroom arrived. The oil in their lamps is a sign of their [vigilance](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/1pe/5/6-10/s_1156006). The importance of preparedness is especially important when deception is rampant and persecution increases. If we do not know what God has to say about a thing, if we are driven by opinion and speculation, how can we be [ready to serve](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/2ti/2/20-26/s_1127020) YWHW?

Therefore, to be [faithful servants](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/heb/11/32-40/s_1144032) and be counted great in the Kingdom, the follower of Christ must [believe](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jas/2/19/s_1148019) in the cross and walk in the light.

When firmly rooted in the truth, we will be sustained in every season and bear fruit in the appointed time.
