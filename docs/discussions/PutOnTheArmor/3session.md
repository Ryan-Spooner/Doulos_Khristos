Faith is our shield against the world, its rulers,and our own wicked hearts, which suppress the truth ([Isaiah 29:13-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/isa/29/13-14/s_708013); [Romans 1:16-26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/rom/1/16-26/s_1047016),[7:14-25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/rom/7/14-25/s_1053014); [John 1:1-18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jhn/1/1-18/s_998001)). Doubters stray ([James 1:1-27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jas/1/1-27/s_1147001); [1 Timothy 4:1-5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/1ti/4/1-5/s_1123001)) and the unrighteous perish ([Psalm 68:2-3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/psa/68/2-3/s_546002); [Luke 13:1-9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/luk/13/1-9/s_986001); [2 Thessalonians 2:7-12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/2th/2/7-12/s_1118007); [Matthew 25:31-46](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/mat/25/31-46/s_954031)). The prodigal son found pleasure in loose living until he remembered (while eating pig slop) the comfort of his father's servants (and desired to be one of them!) ([Luke 15:1-32](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/luk/15/1-32/s_988001)).

Despite our inability to follow God's law ([Genesis 6:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/gen/6/5/s_6005); [Romans 3:1-31](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/rom/3/1-31/s_1049001); [Galatians 3:16-29](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/gal/3/16-29/s_1094016)), we are counted as righteous in Christ ([Jeremiah 31:31-34](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jer/31/31-34/s_776031); [Isaiah 53:2-12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/isa/53/2-12/s_732002)). By *faith* ([1 Timothy 1:3-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/1ti/1/3-11/s_1120003)) we trust God's Word is unchanging ([Isaiah 45:20-25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/isa/45/20-25/s_724020)), take refuge in His promises ([Joshua 21:44-45](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jos/21/44-45/s_208044); [2 Peter 1:2-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/2pe/1/2-11/s_1157002)), and hope for future glory ([Romans 5:1-5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/rom/5/1-5/p1/s_1051001); [1 Corinthians 15:50-58](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/1co/15/50-58/p1/s_1077050)); . Holy, set apart from the world, we are obedient, and He is not overbearing ([Matthew 11:25-30](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/mat/11/25-30/s_940025)). We are to love our God and each other in spirit and truth ([Psalm 51:14-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/psa/51/14-17/s_529014); [John 4:21-26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jhn/4/21-26/s_1001021),[15:1-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jhn/15/1-17/s_1012001),[17:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jhn/17/17/s_1014017),[18:37-38](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jhn/18/37-38/s_1015037); cf. [Isaiah 1:10-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/isa/1/10-17/s_680010); [2 Timothy 4:1-5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/2ti/4/1-5/s_1129001))

## Salvation
>*Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it*
- ([Matthew 7:13-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/mat/7/13-14/s_936013))
 
Christ died on the cross, rose, and became Lord of all ([John 17:1-26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jhn/17/1-12/s_1014001)). The Holy Spirit convicts us of sin ([1 John 1:5-10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/1jo/1/5-10/s_1160005)). God can (and is willing to) forgive us ([Mark 1:40-41](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/mar/1/40-41/s_958040); [Leviticus 13:45-46](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/lev/13/45-46/s_103045); [1 John 2:1-24](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/1jo/2/1-24/s_1161001)). If we repent and are baptized into Christ's death, we are born again ([Colossians 3:5-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/col/3/5-17/s_1110005); [Philippians 2:1-13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/phl/2/1-13/s_1105001)) and become sons of the Most High.

We are justified in Christ ([John 12:44-50](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jhn/12/44-50/s_1009044)). Faith is the door we find grace. God gives us power over sin and writes His will on our heart ([Romans 2:12-29](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/rom/2/12-29/s_1048012); [Ephesians 4:17-24](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/eph/4/17-24/s_1101017)), which is the new covenant.

The church, His bride, are saved ([Matthew 22:1-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/mat/22/1-14/s_951001),[25:1-13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/mat/25/1-13/s_954001); [Romans 2:1-11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/rom/2/1-11/s_1048001); [Revelation 19:7-8](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/rev/19/7-8/s_1186007)). They received the good news and repented ([Acts 2:37-42](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/act/2/37-42/s_1020037)), knowing Christ Jesus fulfilled the Torah on our behalf. His righteousness is our righteousness ([Isaiah 64:1-7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/isa/64/1-7/s_743001);) when we are baptized into His death, born again as children of the Most High ([2 Corinthians 5:14-21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/2co/5/14-21/s_1083014); [Jeremiah 23:5-6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jer/23/5-6/s_768005)), and transformed into the image of His Son ([Romans 12:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/rom/12/1-2/s_1058001); [2 Corinthians 3:16-18](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/2co/3/16-18/s_1081016)).

We are commanded to love ([Deuteronomy 6:4-9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/deu/6/4-9/s_159004); [Jude 1:17-25](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jde/1/17-25/s_1167017);), which is shown through simple and pure devotion to Christ ([2 Corinthians 11:1-3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/2co/11/1-3/s_1089001)). All we do should be in faith, conformed to the will of God ([2 Corinthians 10:3-5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/2co/10/3-5/s_1088003); [Romans 14:13-23](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/rom/14/13-23/s_1060013)). Be steadfast, rooted in the Living Water ([Isaiah 12:1-4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/isa/12/1-4/s_691001); [John 1:1-5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jhn/1/1/s_998001),[4:7-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jhn/4/7-26/s_1001007); [2 Timothy 3:1-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/2ti/3/1-17/s_1128001)), that is Christ Jesus, not disowning our beloved ([Isaiah 63:7-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/isa/63/7-14/s_742007); [Jeremiah 2:1-13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jer/2/1-13/s_747001); [Revelation 2:1-7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/rev/2/1-7/s_1169001)). The Father will keep us in his hands ([John 10:25-30](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/jhn/10/25-30/s_1007025)) until the end of the age, when all things will be made new.

## "...a different Gospel"
- ### Judaizers
	- "Christianity could only be attained through an elaborate system of ceremonial symbolism."
		- Commentary by A. R. Fausset
	- [Galatians 1:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/gal/1/6/s_1092006)
	- *Note*: Christ was born under the law and lived a perfect life, both in context and proper interpretation. The religious leaders' tradition added to the Torah, giving the people a heavy burden and were themselves "whitewashed tombs" ([Matthew 23:1-39](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/mat/23/1-39/s_952001), esp. [verse 27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/mat/23/27/s_952027)) Christ took our punishment upon himself. We are purchased with his blood and no longer subject to the penalty of sin, but are free in Christ.
	- #### [Galatians 2:4-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/gal/2/4-14/s_1093004)
		>But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought in, who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage. But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you...But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For prior to the coming of certain men from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to withdraw and hold himself aloof, fearing the party of the circumcision. The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy. But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, â€œIf you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?"
	- #### [Galatians 2:20-21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/gal/2/20-21/s_1093020)
		>...it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me...if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died needlessly
	- #### [Galatians 3:1-29](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/gal/3/1-29/s_1094001)
		>Did you receive the Spirit by works of the Law or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh...for as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse...no one is justified by the law before God...Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us...so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith...if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise...Why the law then? It was added because of transgressions...until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made...if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based on law. But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe...Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith...that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. For you are all sons of God though faith in Jesus Christ...And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants, heirs according to promise.
	- #### [Galatians 5:1-26](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nasb95/gal/5/1-26/s_1096001)
		>do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery. Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you. And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law. You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. For we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love...For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, â€œYOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF...But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh...But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law...the deedsÂ of the fleshÂ are evident...\[and\] thoseÂ who practiceÂ suchÂ thingsÂ will not inheritÂ the kingdomÂ of God...those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
