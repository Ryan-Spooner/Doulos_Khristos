He's spoken across generations, including those cast from Eden, Abraham and the patriarchs. He led Israel out of Egypt and gave them a law at Sinai.</p> <p>In the first century AD, God's promise of salvation--and a new covenant--was accomplished on Golgotha.

We cannot add to that salvation. Yet we read in 1 Corinthians 3:12-15:</p> <p>Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man\u2019s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man\u2019s work.

You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.</p> <p>And the second is like it--to love our neighbor.</p> <p>The Kingdom of God is built on roles and relationships. God is a father, a king, and a savior. We are called to be bondservants of Christ Jesus, children of the most high, and reign alongside Him as priests.</p> <p>The flesh cannot do the will of God.
